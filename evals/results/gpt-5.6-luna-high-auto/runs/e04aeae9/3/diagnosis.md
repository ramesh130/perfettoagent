## Claims

### c1. The selected frame p95 metric improved slightly, from 59.127166 ms in the baseline to 58.652709 ms in the current trace, a delta of -0.474457 ms.

The `baseline` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.frames.timeline;
WITH
  window_frames AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT f.upid, f.ui_thread_utid, a.id, a.dur, a.jank_type
    FROM android_frames_layers AS f
    JOIN actual_frame_timeline_slice AS a ON a.id = f.actual_frame_timeline_id
    WHERE f.layer_name NOT GLOB '*SurfaceView*' AND a.dur > 0
  ),
  app AS (
    SELECT upid FROM window_frames GROUP BY upid ORDER BY count(*) DESC, upid LIMIT 1
  ),
  frames AS (
    SELECT * FROM window_frames WHERE upid = (SELECT upid FROM app)
  ),
  ranked AS (
    SELECT dur AS ns, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY dur) AS rank, count(*) OVER () AS n
    FROM frames
  )
SELECT (SELECT ns / 1e6 FROM ranked WHERE rank = (n * 95 + 99) / 100) AS value
```

The `current` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.frames.timeline;
WITH
  window_frames AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT f.upid, f.ui_thread_utid, a.id, a.dur, a.jank_type
    FROM android_frames_layers AS f
    JOIN actual_frame_timeline_slice AS a ON a.id = f.actual_frame_timeline_id
    WHERE f.layer_name NOT GLOB '*SurfaceView*' AND a.dur > 0
  ),
  app AS (
    SELECT upid FROM window_frames GROUP BY upid ORDER BY count(*) DESC, upid LIMIT 1
  ),
  frames AS (
    SELECT * FROM window_frames WHERE upid = (SELECT upid FROM app)
  ),
  ranked AS (
    SELECT dur AS ns, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY dur) AS rank, count(*) OVER () AS n
    FROM frames
  )
SELECT (SELECT ns / 1e6 FROM ranked WHERE rank = (n * 95 + 99) / 100) AS value
```

### c2. The measured frames came from com.example.jetnews on the example.jetnews UI thread; the baseline contained 2107 frames and the current trace contained 2061.

The `baseline` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.frames.timeline;
WITH window_frames AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT f.upid, f.ui_thread_utid, a.id, a.dur, a.jank_type
  FROM android_frames_layers AS f JOIN actual_frame_timeline_slice AS a ON a.id = f.actual_frame_timeline_id
  WHERE f.layer_name NOT GLOB '*SurfaceView*' AND a.dur > 0
), app AS (
  SELECT upid FROM window_frames GROUP BY upid ORDER BY count(*) DESC, upid LIMIT 1
), frames AS (SELECT * FROM window_frames WHERE upid = (SELECT upid FROM app))
SELECT p.name AS process_name, t.name AS ui_thread_name, count(*) AS frame_count,
  sum(jank_type GLOB '*App Deadline Missed*') AS app_deadline_missed,
  min(dur)/1e6 AS fastest_frame_ms, max(dur)/1e6 AS slowest_frame_ms
FROM frames f JOIN process p ON p.upid = f.upid JOIN thread t ON t.utid = f.ui_thread_utid
GROUP BY p.name, t.name
```

The `current` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.frames.timeline;
WITH window_frames AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT f.upid, f.ui_thread_utid, a.id, a.dur, a.jank_type
  FROM android_frames_layers AS f JOIN actual_frame_timeline_slice AS a ON a.id = f.actual_frame_timeline_id
  WHERE f.layer_name NOT GLOB '*SurfaceView*' AND a.dur > 0
), app AS (
  SELECT upid FROM window_frames GROUP BY upid ORDER BY count(*) DESC, upid LIMIT 1
), frames AS (SELECT * FROM window_frames WHERE upid = (SELECT upid FROM app))
SELECT p.name AS process_name, t.name AS ui_thread_name, count(*) AS frame_count,
  sum(jank_type GLOB '*App Deadline Missed*') AS app_deadline_missed,
  min(dur)/1e6 AS fastest_frame_ms, max(dur)/1e6 AS slowest_frame_ms
FROM frames f JOIN process p ON p.upid = f.upid JOIN thread t ON t.utid = f.ui_thread_utid
GROUP BY p.name, t.name
```

### c4. The range contains UI-size changes to Interests rows and the topic-selection button, but the trace evidence does not establish either as a performance regression.

## Caveats

- the current trace's build was debuggable (run metadata: debuggable), so ART ran it with fewer optimisations and its timings overstate a release build's
- There is only one capture per side, so the small p95 difference and the opposing p99 result may be run-to-run noise.
- The current run is a debuggable debug build on an Android emulator.
- Startup, heap, and native-allocation metrics had no data in either trace.

## Dropped claims

### c3. The tail metric is mixed rather than a consistent regression: frame p99 increased from 66.911833 ms to 71.153583 ms, while p95 decreased.
