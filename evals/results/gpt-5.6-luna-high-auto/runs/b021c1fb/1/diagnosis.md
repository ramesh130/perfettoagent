    FROM android_frames_layers AS f

## Claims

### c1. The app's 95th-percentile end-to-end UI frame time improved from 81.499417 ms in the baseline to 72.295959 ms in the current trace, a delta of -9.203457999999998 ms.

The `baseline` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.frames.timeline;
WITH
  window_frames AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT f.upid, f.ui_thread_utid, a.id, a.dur, a.jank_type
    FROM android_frames_layers AS f
    JOIN actual_frame_timeline_slice AS a ON a.id = f.actual_frame_timeline_id
    WHERE f.layer_name NOT GLOB '*SurfaceView*' AND a.dur > 0
  ),
  app AS (
    SELECT upid FROM window_frames GROUP BY upid ORDER BY count(*) DESC, upid LIMIT 1
  ),
  frames AS (
    SELECT * FROM window_frames WHERE upid = (SELECT upid FROM app)
  ),
  ranked AS (
    SELECT dur AS ns, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY dur) AS rank, count(*) OVER () AS n
    FROM frames
  )
SELECT (SELECT ns / 1e6 FROM ranked WHERE rank = (n * 95 + 99) / 100) AS value
```

The `current` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.frames.timeline;
WITH
  window_frames AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT f.upid, f.ui_thread_utid, a.id, a.dur, a.jank_type
    FROM android_frames_layers AS f
    JOIN actual_frame_timeline_slice AS a ON a.id = f.actual_frame_timeline_id
    WHERE f.layer_name NOT GLOB '*SurfaceView*' AND a.dur > 0
  ),
  app AS (
    SELECT upid FROM window_frames GROUP BY upid ORDER BY count(*) DESC, upid LIMIT 1
  ),
  frames AS (
    SELECT * FROM window_frames WHERE upid = (SELECT upid FROM app)
  ),
  ranked AS (
    SELECT dur AS ns, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY dur) AS rank, count(*) OVER () AS n
    FROM frames
  )
SELECT (SELECT ns / 1e6 FROM ranked WHERE rank = (n * 95 + 99) / 100) AS value
```

### c2. The increase in whole-trace binder wait is explained by the current trace containing more frames: binder wait per frame decreased from 0.31706249112426 ms to 0.311299026027397 ms.

The `baseline` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.binder;
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.frames.timeline;
WITH window_frames AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT f.upid, f.ui_thread_utid, a.id, a.dur, a.jank_type
  FROM android_frames_layers AS f
  JOIN actual_frame_timeline_slice AS a ON a.id = f.actual_frame_timeline_id
  WHERE f.layer_name NOT GLOB '*SurfaceView*' AND a.dur > 0
), app AS (
  SELECT upid FROM window_frames GROUP BY upid ORDER BY count(*) DESC, upid LIMIT 1
), frames AS (
  SELECT * FROM window_frames WHERE upid=(SELECT upid FROM app)
), waits AS (
  SELECT coalesce(sum(client_dur), 0) AS ns
  FROM android_binder_txns
  WHERE is_sync AND client_dur > 0 AND client_utid IN (SELECT ui_thread_utid FROM frames)
)
SELECT count(*) AS frame_count, ns / 1e6 AS binder_wait_ms, (ns / 1e6) / count(*) AS binder_wait_ms_per_frame
FROM frames CROSS JOIN waits
```

The `current` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.binder;
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.frames.timeline;
WITH window_frames AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT f.upid, f.ui_thread_utid, a.id, a.dur, a.jank_type
  FROM android_frames_layers AS f
  JOIN actual_frame_timeline_slice AS a ON a.id = f.actual_frame_timeline_id
  WHERE f.layer_name NOT GLOB '*SurfaceView*' AND a.dur > 0
), app AS (
  SELECT upid FROM window_frames GROUP BY upid ORDER BY count(*) DESC, upid LIMIT 1
), frames AS (
  SELECT * FROM window_frames WHERE upid=(SELECT upid FROM app)
), waits AS (
  SELECT coalesce(sum(client_dur), 0) AS ns
  FROM android_binder_txns
  WHERE is_sync AND client_dur > 0 AND client_utid IN (SELECT ui_thread_utid FROM frames)
)
SELECT count(*) AS frame_count, ns / 1e6 AS binder_wait_ms, (ns / 1e6) / count(*) AS binder_wait_ms_per_frame
FROM frames CROSS JOIN waits
```

## Caveats

- This conclusion is based on one capture per side, so normal run-to-run variation cannot be ruled out.
- The captures were made on an Android emulator using a benchmark build.
- Whole-trace totals such as binder wait are sensitive to the number and duration of frames; the normalized binder result does not indicate a regression.

## Dropped claims

### c3. The range includes a TV-screen change and a MoQ-screen change, but the traces do not show a corresponding UI-frame regression to attribute to either commit.
