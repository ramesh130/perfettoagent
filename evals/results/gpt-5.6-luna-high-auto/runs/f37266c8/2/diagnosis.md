## Claims

### c1. The selected UI-frame p95 metric improved from 76.544292 ms in baseline to 73.255125 ms in current, a delta of -3.289167 ms; this is not a frame-time regression.

### c3. The trace-localized binder wait did increase on the app's UI thread, but it is a whole-trace aggregate: synchronous calls to SurfaceFlinger rose from 371 calls and 287.81833 ms to 400 calls and 348.319381 ms while the number of recorded frames also rose from 746 to 834.

### c4. Blame identifies two behavior-changing UI lines in the range—the TV control timeout and download-row padding—but neither is directly implicated by the trace evidence, so no culprit commit is attributed.

## Caveats

- This conclusion is based on one capture per side; small aggregate differences can be run-to-run noise.
- The increased binder total is not normalized per frame, and the current capture contains more recorded frames, so it is not sufficient evidence of a UI-frame regression.
