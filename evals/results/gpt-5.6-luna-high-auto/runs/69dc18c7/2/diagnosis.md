## Claims

### c1. Main-thread blocked time increased from 25.284169 ms in the baseline to 731.530503 ms in the current trace, a delta of 706.2463339999999 ms.

The `baseline` trace: 1 row.

      JOIN work AS w ON b.ts < w.ts + w.dur AND w.ts < b.ts + b.dur
    ), 0) / 1e6
  END AS value
```

The `current` trace: 1 row.

```sql

### c2. The current trace contains six named input-delivery slices lasting at least 100 ms, totaling 727.312415 ms; the baseline contains none.

The `current` trace: 1 row.

```sql
SELECT count(*) AS long_named_input_events,
  coalesce(sum(dur), 0) / 1e6 AS long_named_input_ms,
  coalesce(max(dur), 0) / 1e6 AS max_long_named_input_ms
FROM slice
WHERE name GLOB 'deliverInputEvent src=*' AND dur >= 100000000
```

The `baseline` trace: 1 row.

```sql
SELECT count(*) AS long_named_input_events,
  coalesce(sum(dur), 0) / 1e6 AS long_named_input_ms,
  coalesce(max(dur), 0) / 1e6 AS max_long_named_input_ms
FROM slice
WHERE name GLOB 'deliverInputEvent src=*' AND dur >= 100000000
```

### c3. Those six current input-delivery slices are predominantly S-state waits, each lasting about 120 ms; this matches the 120 ms main-thread sleep added by the culprit commit.

The `current` trace: 6 rows.

```sql
SELECT s.name AS slice_name, s.dur / 1e6 AS duration_ms,
  ts.state, ts.dur / 1e6 AS blocked_state_ms
FROM slice AS s
JOIN thread_track AS tt ON tt.id = s.track_id
JOIN thread_state AS ts ON ts.utid = tt.utid
  AND ts.ts < s.ts + s.dur AND s.ts < ts.ts + ts.dur
WHERE s.name GLOB 'deliverInputEvent src=*'
  AND s.dur >= 100000000
  AND ts.state NOT IN ('Running', 'R', 'R+')
ORDER BY s.dur DESC
```

## Caveats

- There is only one capture per side, so unrelated run-to-run noise cannot be quantified.
- The current run is a non-debuggable benchmark build on an emulator; the trace evidence establishes the blocking behavior but not source line-level runtime attribution beyond the matching commit change.
