## Metric

| Metric | Unit | Baseline | Current | Delta |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `startup_ttid_ms` | ms | 425.9 | 386.76 | -39.14 |

Measured by:

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.startup.startups;
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.startup.time_to_display;
WITH
  cold AS (
    SELECT s.package, d.time_to_initial_display AS ns
    FROM android_startups AS s
    JOIN android_startup_time_to_display AS d USING (startup_id)
    WHERE s.startup_type = 'cold'
  ),
  app AS (
    SELECT package FROM cold GROUP BY package ORDER BY count(*) DESC, package LIMIT 1
  ),
  ranked AS (
    SELECT ns, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY ns) AS rank, count(*) OVER () AS n
    FROM cold
    WHERE package = (SELECT package FROM app) AND ns IS NOT NULL
  )
SELECT (SELECT ns / 1e6 FROM ranked WHERE rank = (n + 1) / 2) AS value
```

## Claims

### c2. The startup rows used for the comparison are cold starts of com.superplayer.demo in both captures.

The `baseline` trace: 20 rows.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.startup.startups;
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.startup.time_to_display;
SELECT s.startup_id, s.package, s.startup_type,
  d.time_to_initial_display / 1e6 AS ttid_ms,
  d.time_to_full_display / 1e6 AS ttfd_ms
FROM android_startups s JOIN android_startup_time_to_display d USING (startup_id)
WHERE s.startup_type = 'cold' AND s.package = 'com.superplayer.demo'
ORDER BY s.startup_id
```

The `current` trace: 20 rows.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.startup.startups;
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.startup.time_to_display;
SELECT s.startup_id, s.package, s.startup_type,
  d.time_to_initial_display / 1e6 AS ttid_ms,
  d.time_to_full_display / 1e6 AS ttfd_ms
FROM android_startups s JOIN android_startup_time_to_display d USING (startup_id)
WHERE s.startup_type = 'cold' AND s.package = 'com.superplayer.demo'
ORDER BY s.startup_id
```

### c3. The range's top commit is a FeedScreen handler rename, not an observed startup-path change.

Commit, changing `demo/src/main/kotlin/com/superplayer/demo/FeedScreen.kt`:

```text
d06e018fc738bebf0f5ccf2814efba445a6cfdfe
```

### c4. No commit is attributed because the app-level startup metric improved across the range rather than regressing.

Commit, changing `demo/src/main/kotlin/com/superplayer/demo/FeedScreen.kt`:

```text
d06e018fc738bebf0f5ccf2814efba445a6cfdfe
```

The `baseline` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.startup.startups;
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.startup.time_to_display;
WITH
  cold AS (
    SELECT s.package, d.time_to_initial_display AS ns
    FROM android_startups AS s
    JOIN android_startup_time_to_display AS d USING (startup_id)
    WHERE s.startup_type = 'cold'
  ),
  app AS (
    SELECT package FROM cold GROUP BY package ORDER BY count(*) DESC, package LIMIT 1
  ),
  ranked AS (
    SELECT ns, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY ns) AS rank, count(*) OVER () AS n
    FROM cold
    WHERE package = (SELECT package FROM app) AND ns IS NOT NULL
  )
SELECT (SELECT ns / 1e6 FROM ranked WHERE rank = (n + 1) / 2) AS value
```

The `current` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.startup.startups;
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.startup.time_to_display;
WITH
  cold AS (
    SELECT s.package, d.time_to_initial_display AS ns
    FROM android_startups AS s
    JOIN android_startup_time_to_display AS d USING (startup_id)
    WHERE s.startup_type = 'cold'
  ),
  app AS (
    SELECT package FROM cold GROUP BY package ORDER BY count(*) DESC, package LIMIT 1
  ),
  ranked AS (
    SELECT ns, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY ns) AS rank, count(*) OVER () AS n
    FROM cold
    WHERE package = (SELECT package FROM app) AND ns IS NOT NULL
  )
SELECT (SELECT ns / 1e6 FROM ranked WHERE rank = (n + 1) / 2) AS value
```

## Caveats

- This conclusion is based on one baseline/current trace pair; run-to-run noise cannot be estimated reliably.
- The captures were made on an Android emulator, so the absolute startup times may not represent physical-device performance.
- The generic frame-based metrics select the launcher as the dominant framed process in these traces, so startup TTID is the more appropriate app-level metric here.

## Dropped claims

### c1. Cold-start time to initial display improved from 425.901458 ms in the baseline to 386.763334 ms in the current trace, a delta of -39.138124 ms.
