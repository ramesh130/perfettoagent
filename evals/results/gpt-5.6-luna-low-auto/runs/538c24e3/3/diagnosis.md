## Metric

| Metric | Unit | Baseline | Current | Delta |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `heap_growth_objects_by_class` | objects | 399,535 | 399,352 | -183 |

Measured by:

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.memory.heap_graph.heap_graph_class_aggregation;
SELECT sum(value) AS value FROM (
SELECT type_name AS key, SUM(reachable_obj_count) AS value
FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
WHERE graph_sample_ts = (
  SELECT MAX(graph_sample_ts) FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
)
GROUP BY type_name
HAVING value > 0
ORDER BY key

)
```

## Claims

### c1. The selected metric does not regress: reachable Java objects decreased from 399535 in the baseline trace to 399352 in the current trace, a delta of -183 objects.

The `baseline` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.memory.heap_graph.heap_graph_class_aggregation;
SELECT sum(value) AS value FROM (
SELECT type_name AS key, SUM(reachable_obj_count) AS value
FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
WHERE graph_sample_ts = (
  SELECT MAX(graph_sample_ts) FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
)
GROUP BY type_name
HAVING value > 0
ORDER BY key

)
```

The `current` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.memory.heap_graph.heap_graph_class_aggregation;
SELECT sum(value) AS value FROM (
SELECT type_name AS key, SUM(reachable_obj_count) AS value
FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
WHERE graph_sample_ts = (
  SELECT MAX(graph_sample_ts) FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
)
GROUP BY type_name
HAVING value > 0
ORDER BY key

)
```

### c2. The largest reported class-level changes are decreases in float[] by 107 objects and java.util.WeakHashMap$Entry by 74 objects; the listed positive changes are only one object each.

The `baseline` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.memory.heap_graph.heap_graph_class_aggregation;
SELECT 'float[]' AS key, coalesce((SELECT value FROM (
SELECT type_name AS key, SUM(reachable_obj_count) AS value
FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
WHERE graph_sample_ts = (
  SELECT MAX(graph_sample_ts) FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
)
GROUP BY type_name
HAVING value > 0
ORDER BY key

) WHERE key IS 'float[]'), 0) AS value
```

The `current` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.memory.heap_graph.heap_graph_class_aggregation;
SELECT 'float[]' AS key, coalesce((SELECT value FROM (
SELECT type_name AS key, SUM(reachable_obj_count) AS value
FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
WHERE graph_sample_ts = (
  SELECT MAX(graph_sample_ts) FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
)
GROUP BY type_name
HAVING value > 0
ORDER BY key

) WHERE key IS 'float[]'), 0) AS value
```

## Caveats

- the current trace's build was debuggable (run metadata: debuggable), so ART ran it with fewer optimisations and its timings overstate a release build's
- The frame, binder, GC, main-thread-blocked, and startup metrics had no usable data in either trace, so this diagnosis is limited to reachable Java-heap objects.
- This compares one baseline capture with one current capture; small changes can still reflect capture-to-capture variability.
- The current trace metadata identifies a debuggable build on an Android emulator (sdk_gphone64_arm64, SDK 36).
