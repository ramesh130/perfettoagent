## Claims

### c1. The selected frame p95 metric improved from 81.499417 ms in the baseline to 72.5605 ms in the current trace, a delta of -8.93891699999999 ms.

The `baseline` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.frames.timeline;
WITH
  window_frames AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT f.upid, f.ui_thread_utid, a.id, a.dur, a.jank_type
    FROM android_frames_layers AS f
    JOIN actual_frame_timeline_slice AS a ON a.id = f.actual_frame_timeline_id
    WHERE f.layer_name NOT GLOB '*SurfaceView*' AND a.dur > 0
  ),
  app AS (
    SELECT upid FROM window_frames GROUP BY upid ORDER BY count(*) DESC, upid LIMIT 1
  ),
  frames AS (
    SELECT * FROM window_frames WHERE upid = (SELECT upid FROM app)
  ),
  ranked AS (
    SELECT dur AS ns, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY dur) AS rank, count(*) OVER () AS n
    FROM frames
  )
SELECT (SELECT ns / 1e6 FROM ranked WHERE rank = (n * 95 + 99) / 100) AS value
```

The `current` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.frames.timeline;
WITH
  window_frames AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT f.upid, f.ui_thread_utid, a.id, a.dur, a.jank_type
    FROM android_frames_layers AS f
    JOIN actual_frame_timeline_slice AS a ON a.id = f.actual_frame_timeline_id
    WHERE f.layer_name NOT GLOB '*SurfaceView*' AND a.dur > 0
  ),
  app AS (
    SELECT upid FROM window_frames GROUP BY upid ORDER BY count(*) DESC, upid LIMIT 1
  ),
  frames AS (
    SELECT * FROM window_frames WHERE upid = (SELECT upid FROM app)
  ),
  ranked AS (
    SELECT dur AS ns, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY dur) AS rank, count(*) OVER () AS n
    FROM frames
  )
SELECT (SELECT ns / 1e6 FROM ranked WHERE rank = (n * 95 + 99) / 100) AS value
```

### c2. The app-deadline-missed frame share also decreased from 54.7337278106509% to 45.5661664392906%.

The `baseline` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.frames.timeline;
WITH
  window_frames AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT f.upid, f.ui_thread_utid, a.id, a.dur, a.jank_type
    FROM android_frames_layers AS f
    JOIN actual_frame_timeline_slice AS a ON a.id = f.actual_frame_timeline_id
    WHERE f.layer_name NOT GLOB '*SurfaceView*' AND a.dur > 0
  ),
  app AS (
    SELECT upid FROM window_frames GROUP BY upid ORDER BY count(*) DESC, upid LIMIT 1
  ),
  frames AS (
    SELECT * FROM window_frames WHERE upid = (SELECT upid FROM app)
  )
SELECT 100.0 * sum(jank_type GLOB '*App Deadline Missed*') / count(*) AS value
FROM frames
```

The `current` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.frames.timeline;
WITH
  window_frames AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT f.upid, f.ui_thread_utid, a.id, a.dur, a.jank_type
    FROM android_frames_layers AS f
    JOIN actual_frame_timeline_slice AS a ON a.id = f.actual_frame_timeline_id
    WHERE f.layer_name NOT GLOB '*SurfaceView*' AND a.dur > 0
  ),
  app AS (
    SELECT upid FROM window_frames GROUP BY upid ORDER BY count(*) DESC, upid LIMIT 1
  ),
  frames AS (
    SELECT * FROM window_frames WHERE upid = (SELECT upid FROM app)
  )
SELECT 100.0 * sum(jank_type GLOB '*App Deadline Missed*') / count(*) AS value
FROM frames
```

### c3. The current trace contains substantial main-thread blocking and garbage-collection time, but those are not reflected as a frame-p95 regression; the single-capture comparison does not establish that either is caused by a commit in the range.

Commit, changing `demo/src/main/kotlin/com/superplayer/demo/DownloadsScreen.kt`:

```text
c0fea1b563cbe2b5304726700793a7d4d7adcd11
```

Commit, changing `gradle.properties`:

```text

```

## Caveats

- Each side has only one capture, so changes in binder wait, main-thread blocking, and GC time may be run-to-run noise.
- The current run is a non-debuggable benchmark build on an Android SDK emulator.
- No commit is attributed because the primary frame metrics improved and the trace evidence does not directly identify a range commit as a performance regression.
