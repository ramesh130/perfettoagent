### c3. Commit 6efb841e removed the resetForReuse cleanup that removed delegate listeners and cleared wrappedListeners; this directly matches the growth in retained listener objects.

## Caveats

- The heap metric compares the last heap dump in each trace; it is an object-count signal rather than a direct retained-byte measurement.
- Only one capture per side is available, so smaller changes may include run-to-run variation.
- The current capture is a non-debuggable benchmark build on an Android emulator; frame, startup, binder, GC, and native-heap metrics had no usable data in these traces.
