```

## Claims

### c2. The current trace spends substantial UI-frame time in AndroidOwner:measureAndLayout, Compose:recompose, and TextLayout:initLayout, consistent with the changed post-card title measurement and animation code.

The `current` trace: 30 rows.

```sql
SELECT name, count(*) AS n, sum(dur)/1e6 AS total_ms, max(dur)/1e6 AS max_ms FROM slice WHERE name GLOB '*measure*' OR name GLOB '*layout*' OR name GLOB '*compose*' OR name GLOB '*Text*' GROUP BY name ORDER BY total_ms DESC LIMIT 30
```

```

### c3. Commit e15d633e introduced repeated text measurement in PostTitle and an infinite row-breath animation in PostCards.kt; blame identifies the changed PostTitle implementation as introduced by that commit.

## Caveats

- the current trace's build was debuggable (run metadata: debuggable), so ART ran it with fewer optimisations and its timings overstate a release build's
- Only one capture per side is available, so run-to-run variability cannot be quantified.
- The current run metadata identifies a debuggable build on an Android emulator (sdk_gphone64_arm64, SDK 36).
- The trace evidence localizes the regression to UI measurement/recomposition but does not prove which of the two PostCards changes is solely responsible.

## Dropped claims

### c1. The app UI-thread frame p95 increased from 26.299542 ms in baseline to 103.761958 ms in current, a 77.462416 ms regression.
