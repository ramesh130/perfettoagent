## Claims

### c1. The app UI-thread p95 frame time increased from 37.952167 ms to 69.289541 ms, a delta of 31.337373999999997 ms.

The `baseline` trace: 1 row.

### c2. The current trace shows substantially more text-layout work: TextLayout:initLayout appears 1,859,699 times for 7,192.994139 ms, versus 288 times for 69.199128 ms in baseline.

The `baseline` trace: 3 rows.

```sql
SELECT name, count(*) AS cnt, sum(dur)/1e6 AS total_ms FROM slice WHERE name IN ('TextLayout:initLayout','animation','Recomposer:recompose') GROUP BY name ORDER BY name
```

The `current` trace: 3 rows.

```sql
SELECT name, count(*) AS cnt, sum(dur)/1e6 AS total_ms FROM slice WHERE name IN ('TextLayout:initLayout','animation','Recomposer:recompose') GROUP BY name ORDER BY name
```

### c3. The attributed commit replaced the plain row title with RowTitle, whose implementation repeatedly calls rememberTextMeasurer().measure in a size-increment loop, and also added an infinite row-breath animation.

## Caveats

- Only one capture per side is available, so run-to-run variance cannot be measured.
- The current run metadata identifies an emulator benchmark build on sdk 36; the build is non-debuggable.
