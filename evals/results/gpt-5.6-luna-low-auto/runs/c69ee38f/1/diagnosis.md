## Claims

### c1. The app UI-thread frame p95 improved from 65.80025 ms in the baseline trace to 56.004625 ms in the current trace, a delta of -9.795625 ms rather than a regression.

The `baseline` trace: 1 row.

    SELECT DISTINCT f.upid, f.ui_thread_utid, a.id, a.dur, a.jank_type

    JOIN actual_frame_timeline_slice AS a ON a.id = f.actual_frame_timeline_id
    WHERE f.layer_name NOT GLOB '*SurfaceView*' AND a.dur > 0
  ),

### c2. The only directly blamed code change inspected in the range is a handler-variable rename; the diff changes `mainThread` to `mainHandler` and preserves the same Handler construction and post operation.

## Caveats

- Each side is a single capture, so small changes could be run-to-run noise; this observed change is an improvement, not a worsening.
- The current trace metadata identifies an emulator benchmark build on sdk_gphone64_arm64, SDK 36, and does not provide baseline build metadata.
