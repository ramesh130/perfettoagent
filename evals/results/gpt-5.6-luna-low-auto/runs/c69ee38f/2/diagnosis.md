## Metric

| Metric | Unit | Baseline | Current | Delta |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `frame_p95_ms` | ms | 128.09 | 123.49 | -4.6 |

Measured by:

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.frames.timeline;
WITH
  window_frames AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT f.upid, f.ui_thread_utid, a.id, a.dur, a.jank_type
    FROM android_frames_layers AS f
    JOIN actual_frame_timeline_slice AS a ON a.id = f.actual_frame_timeline_id
    WHERE f.layer_name NOT GLOB '*SurfaceView*' AND a.dur > 0
  ),
  app AS (
    SELECT upid FROM window_frames GROUP BY upid ORDER BY count(*) DESC, upid LIMIT 1
  ),
  frames AS (
    SELECT * FROM window_frames WHERE upid = (SELECT upid FROM app)
  ),
  ranked AS (
    SELECT dur AS ns, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY dur) AS rank, count(*) OVER () AS n
    FROM frames
  )
SELECT (SELECT ns / 1e6 FROM ranked WHERE rank = (n * 95 + 99) / 100) AS value
```

## Claims

### c1. The app's frame p95 improved from 128.089417 ms in the baseline to 123.491875 ms in the current trace, a delta of -4.597542 ms; therefore the measured change is not a performance regression.

The `baseline` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.frames.timeline;
WITH
  window_frames AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT f.upid, f.ui_thread_utid, a.id, a.dur, a.jank_type
    FROM android_frames_layers AS f
    JOIN actual_frame_timeline_slice AS a ON a.id = f.actual_frame_timeline_id
    WHERE f.layer_name NOT GLOB '*SurfaceView*' AND a.dur > 0
  ),
  app AS (
    SELECT upid FROM window_frames GROUP BY upid ORDER BY count(*) DESC, upid LIMIT 1
  ),
  frames AS (
    SELECT * FROM window_frames WHERE upid = (SELECT upid FROM app)
  ),
  ranked AS (
    SELECT dur AS ns, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY dur) AS rank, count(*) OVER () AS n
    FROM frames
  )
SELECT (SELECT ns / 1e6 FROM ranked WHERE rank = (n * 95 + 99) / 100) AS value
```

The `current` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.frames.timeline;
WITH
  window_frames AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT f.upid, f.ui_thread_utid, a.id, a.dur, a.jank_type
    FROM android_frames_layers AS f
    JOIN actual_frame_timeline_slice AS a ON a.id = f.actual_frame_timeline_id
    WHERE f.layer_name NOT GLOB '*SurfaceView*' AND a.dur > 0
  ),
  app AS (
    SELECT upid FROM window_frames GROUP BY upid ORDER BY count(*) DESC, upid LIMIT 1
  ),
  frames AS (
    SELECT * FROM window_frames WHERE upid = (SELECT upid FROM app)
  ),
  ranked AS (
    SELECT dur AS ns, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY dur) AS rank, count(*) OVER () AS n
    FROM frames
  )
SELECT (SELECT ns / 1e6 FROM ranked WHERE rank = (n * 95 + 99) / 100) AS value
```

### c2. The current build corresponds to the range head d06e018fc738bebf0f5ccf2814efba445a6cfdfe and is a clean non-debuggable benchmark build on an Android SDK 36 emulator.

Commit, changing `demo/src/main/kotlin/com/superplayer/demo/FeedScreen.kt`:

```

## Caveats

- Only one capture per side is available, so the measured improvement may include run-to-run variability.
- The capture ran on an emulator, and the build was non-debuggable; no commit in the range is attributed because the measured metric improved rather than regressed.
