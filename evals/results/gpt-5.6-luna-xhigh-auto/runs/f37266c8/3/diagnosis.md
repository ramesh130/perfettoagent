## Claims

### c1. The selected frame_p95_ms metric improved, falling from 76.544292 ms in the baseline to 73.255125 ms in the current trace; this does not show a frame-latency regression.

The `baseline` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.frames.timeline;
WITH
  window_frames AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT f.upid, f.ui_thread_utid, a.id, a.dur, a.jank_type
    FROM android_frames_layers AS f
    JOIN actual_frame_timeline_slice AS a ON a.id = f.actual_frame_timeline_id
    WHERE f.layer_name NOT GLOB '*SurfaceView*' AND a.dur > 0
  ),
  app AS (
    SELECT upid FROM window_frames GROUP BY upid ORDER BY count(*) DESC, upid LIMIT 1
  ),
  frames AS (
    SELECT * FROM window_frames WHERE upid = (SELECT upid FROM app)
  ),
  ranked AS (
    SELECT dur AS ns, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY dur) AS rank, count(*) OVER () AS n
    FROM frames
  )
SELECT (SELECT ns / 1e6 FROM ranked WHERE rank = (n * 95 + 99) / 100) AS value
```

The `current` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.frames.timeline;
WITH
  window_frames AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT f.upid, f.ui_thread_utid, a.id, a.dur, a.jank_type
    FROM android_frames_layers AS f
    JOIN actual_frame_timeline_slice AS a ON a.id = f.actual_frame_timeline_id
    WHERE f.layer_name NOT GLOB '*SurfaceView*' AND a.dur > 0
  ),
  app AS (
    SELECT upid FROM window_frames GROUP BY upid ORDER BY count(*) DESC, upid LIMIT 1
  ),
  frames AS (
    SELECT * FROM window_frames WHERE upid = (SELECT upid FROM app)
  ),
  ranked AS (
    SELECT dur AS ns, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY dur) AS rank, count(*) OVER () AS n
    FROM frames
  )
SELECT (SELECT ns / 1e6 FROM ranked WHERE rank = (n * 95 + 99) / 100) AS value
```

### c2. The frame metric selects com.superplayer.demo on its UI thread in both traces. The baseline contains 746 app frame rows, while the current contains 834, so the captures do not have identical frame populations.

The `baseline` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.frames.timeline;
WITH window_frames AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT f.upid, f.ui_thread_utid, a.id, a.ts, a.dur
  FROM android_frames_layers AS f
  JOIN actual_frame_timeline_slice AS a ON a.id = f.actual_frame_timeline_id
  WHERE f.layer_name NOT GLOB '*SurfaceView*' AND a.dur > 0
), app AS (
  SELECT upid FROM window_frames GROUP BY upid ORDER BY count(*) DESC, upid LIMIT 1
)
SELECT p.name AS process_name, p.upid, t.name AS ui_thread_name, t.utid,
       count(*) AS frame_count,
       min(w.ts) / 1e9 AS first_frame_s,
       max(w.ts + w.dur) / 1e9 AS last_frame_s
FROM window_frames AS w
JOIN app USING (upid)
JOIN process AS p USING (upid)
JOIN thread AS t ON t.utid = w.ui_thread_utid
GROUP BY p.name, p.upid, t.name, t.utid
```

The `current` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.frames.timeline;
WITH window_frames AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT f.upid, f.ui_thread_utid, a.id, a.ts, a.dur
  FROM android_frames_layers AS f
  JOIN actual_frame_timeline_slice AS a ON a.id = f.actual_frame_timeline_id
  WHERE f.layer_name NOT GLOB '*SurfaceView*' AND a.dur > 0
), app AS (
  SELECT upid FROM window_frames GROUP BY upid ORDER BY count(*) DESC, upid LIMIT 1
)
SELECT p.name AS process_name, p.upid, t.name AS ui_thread_name, t.utid,
       count(*) AS frame_count,
       min(w.ts) / 1e9 AS first_frame_s,
       max(w.ts + w.dur) / 1e9 AS last_frame_s
FROM window_frames AS w
JOIN app USING (upid)
JOIN process AS p USING (upid)
JOIN thread AS t ON t.utid = w.ui_thread_utid
GROUP BY p.name, p.upid, t.name, t.utid
```

### c3. The range contains a FeedScreen acquisition change in commit 328304f8f1081e484f20030bb6518b1b1ee03c82, but the observed frame-tail metric improved rather than regressed, so there is no evidence to attribute a performance regression to it.

### c4. Blame at the range head assigns the FeedRow acquisition expression to commit 328304f8f1081e484f20030bb6518b1b1ee03c82; the trace evidence does not support calling it a regression culprit.

## Caveats

- This is one capture per side; the approximately 4% p95 improvement may be run-to-run noise rather than a meaningful optimization.
- The current run is recorded as a clean, non-debuggable benchmark build on an Android 36 emulator; emulator scheduling and media workload can affect frame measurements.
- The differing app frame populations limit direct attribution across the two captures.
