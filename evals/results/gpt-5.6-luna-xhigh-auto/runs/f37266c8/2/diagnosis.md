## Claims

### c1. The selected end-to-end UI frame p95 improved from 76.544292 ms in baseline to 73.255125 ms in current, a delta of -3.289166999999992 ms; this metric does not show a regression.

### c5. Blame at the range head places the FeedScreen player-acquisition expression in 328304f8f1081e484f20030bb6518b1b1ee03c82 and the latest FeedScreen collector-line edit in f871266864fac1b4f44ff750e6a2fc5d5b07d4a1; because the selected frame metric improved, neither is assigned as a culprit.

## Caveats

- There is only one capture per side, so the 3.289 ms p95 difference may be run-to-run noise.
- The current run is an emulator benchmark capture; device scheduling and SurfaceFlinger variability can affect these measurements.
- Binder wait should be investigated separately with repeated captures if binder latency, rather than frame delivery, is the target metric.

## Dropped claims

### c4. Whole-trace synchronous binder wait is a contrary signal, increasing from 287.81833 ms to 348.319381 ms, but it is a separate aggregate metric and does not establish a frame-time regression.
