## Metric

Measured by:

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.startup.startups;
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.startup.time_to_display;
WITH
  cold AS (
    SELECT s.package, d.time_to_full_display AS ns
    FROM android_startups AS s
    JOIN android_startup_time_to_display AS d USING (startup_id)
    WHERE s.startup_type = 'cold'
  ),
  app AS (

  ),
  ranked AS (
    SELECT ns, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY ns) AS rank, count(*) OVER () AS n

    WHERE package = (SELECT package FROM app) AND ns IS NOT NULL
  )
SELECT (SELECT ns / 1e6 FROM ranked WHERE rank = (n + 1) / 2) AS value
```

## Claims

### c2. The startup delay is localized to the app process's main thread: bindApplication durations were substantially longer in current than baseline.

The `baseline` trace: 20 rows.

```sql
SELECT p.name AS process_name, t.name AS thread_name, s.name, s.dur
FROM slice s
JOIN thread_track tt ON tt.id=s.track_id
JOIN thread t ON t.utid=tt.utid
JOIN process p ON p.upid=t.upid
WHERE p.name='com.superplayer.demo' AND s.name='bindApplication'
ORDER BY s.ts
```

The `current` trace: 20 rows.

```sql
SELECT p.name AS process_name, t.name AS thread_name, s.name, s.dur
FROM slice s
JOIN thread_track tt ON tt.id=s.track_id
JOIN thread t ON t.utid=tt.utid
JOIN process p ON p.upid=t.upid
WHERE p.name='com.superplayer.demo' AND s.name='bindApplication'
ORDER BY s.ts
```

### c3. The current-range head adds DemoApplication as the manifest application class and performs catalog-cache rebuilding and checksum file I/O during Application.onCreate.

### c4. The added DemoApplication lines are attributed by blame to fb30a9c67862bd42f9d8fab36f6c8dff37069417, including the cache rebuild and checksum operations.

## Caveats

- Each side contains one capture scenario with multiple cold starts, so run-to-run noise cannot be independently estimated.
- The trace was recorded on the sdk_gphone64_arm64 Android emulator rather than physical hardware.

## Dropped claims

### c1. Median cold-start time to full display increased from 2077.310959 ms in baseline to 2723.988335 ms in current, a 646.677376 ms regression.
