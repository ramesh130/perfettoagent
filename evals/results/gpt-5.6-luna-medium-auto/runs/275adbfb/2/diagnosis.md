Measured by:

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.startup.startups;

WITH
  cold AS (
    SELECT s.package, d.time_to_full_display AS ns
    FROM android_startups AS s

    FROM cold
    WHERE package = (SELECT package FROM app) AND ns IS NOT NULL
  )
SELECT (SELECT ns / 1e6 FROM ranked WHERE rank = (n + 1) / 2) AS value
```

## Claims

### c2. The startup measurements are for com.superplayer.demo cold starts: the baseline contains 20 startup rows and the current trace contains 20 startup rows, with the current rows showing consistently higher time-to-full-display values.

The `baseline` trace: 20 rows.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.startup.startups;
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.startup.time_to_display;
SELECT s.startup_id, s.package, s.startup_type, d.time_to_initial_display/1e6 AS ttid_ms, d.time_to_full_display/1e6 AS ttfd_ms
FROM android_startups s JOIN android_startup_time_to_display d USING(startup_id)
WHERE s.package='com.superplayer.demo'
ORDER BY s.startup_id
```

The `current` trace: 20 rows.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.startup.startups;
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.startup.time_to_display;
SELECT s.startup_id, s.package, s.startup_type, d.time_to_initial_display/1e6 AS ttid_ms, d.time_to_full_display/1e6 AS ttfd_ms
FROM android_startups s JOIN android_startup_time_to_display d USING(startup_id)
WHERE s.package='com.superplayer.demo'
ORDER BY s.startup_id
```

### c3. Commit fb30a9c67862bd42f9d8fab36f6c8dff37069417 registers DemoApplication as the app Application class and adds launch-time catalog-cache rebuilding and checksum work, making it the correlated culprit for the startup regression.

## Caveats

- The captures run on an SDK 36 sdk_gphone64_arm64 emulator, so absolute startup timings may not represent physical devices.
- The trace evidence establishes the startup regression and correlates it with the launch-time Application change; it does not directly attribute individual startup samples to a specific Java method.

## Dropped claims

### c1. Median cold-start time to full display increased from 2077.310959 ms in the baseline to 2723.988335 ms in the current trace, a 646.677376 ms regression.

### c4. The trace also shows the app's median time to initial display increased from 349.682708 ms to 664.881333 ms, consistent with launch-time work affecting startup rather than only post-display rendering.
