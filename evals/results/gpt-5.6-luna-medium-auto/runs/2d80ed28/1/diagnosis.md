# Inconclusive

- **Metric:** `frame_ui_time_p95_ms` +27.96 ms (26.21 → 54.17 ms)
- **Culprit:** none attributed; the verifier dropped the model's: no surviving claim cites the culprit commit bcd3ba1e926293a8681b6246ecdd271b5beb1592
- **Verified:** 0 claims kept, 1 dropped; 1 of 2 citations passed
- **Current build:** debuggable; see Caveats
- **Verdict changed** by the verifier from `regression`: no claim survived verification: all 1 were dropped
- **Model's confidence:** none; the verifier changed what it was given for

## Claims

No claim survived the verifier.

## Caveats

- the current trace's build was debuggable (run metadata: debuggable), so ART ran it with fewer optimisations and its timings overstate a release build's
- This conclusion is based on one capture per build; run-to-run variability cannot be estimated from these traces alone.
- The captures were made on an Android emulator with a debuggable build.

## Dropped claims

### c1. The app UI thread's p95 frame work increased from 26.206625 ms in the baseline to 54.169584 ms in the current trace.

Dropped: citation 2: did not run: trace processor failed: Traceback (most recent call last): File "stdin" line 26 col 1 SELECT json_group_array(name) AS __perfettoagent_columns FROM pragma_table_info('__perfettoagent_query') ^ circular reference: frames
