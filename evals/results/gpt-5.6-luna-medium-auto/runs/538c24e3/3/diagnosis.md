## Metric

| Metric | Unit | Baseline | Current | Delta |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `heap_growth_objects_by_class` | objects | 399,535 | 399,352 | -183 |

Measured by:

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.memory.heap_graph.heap_graph_class_aggregation;
SELECT sum(value) AS value FROM (
SELECT type_name AS key, SUM(reachable_obj_count) AS value
FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
WHERE graph_sample_ts = (
  SELECT MAX(graph_sample_ts) FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
)
GROUP BY type_name
HAVING value > 0
ORDER BY key

)
```

## Claims

### c1. Reachable Java objects decreased by 183 from baseline to current, so the measured heap metric did not regress.

The `baseline` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.memory.heap_graph.heap_graph_class_aggregation;
SELECT sum(value) AS value FROM (
SELECT type_name AS key, SUM(reachable_obj_count) AS value
FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
WHERE graph_sample_ts = (
  SELECT MAX(graph_sample_ts) FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
)
GROUP BY type_name
HAVING value > 0
ORDER BY key

)
```

The `current` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.memory.heap_graph.heap_graph_class_aggregation;
SELECT sum(value) AS value FROM (
SELECT type_name AS key, SUM(reachable_obj_count) AS value
FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
WHERE graph_sample_ts = (
  SELECT MAX(graph_sample_ts) FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
)
GROUP BY type_name
HAVING value > 0
ORDER BY key

)
```

### c2. The class breakdown does not show a growth pattern suggesting a leak: java.util.WeakHashMap$Entry decreased by 74 objects and float[] decreased by 107 objects.

The `baseline` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.memory.heap_graph.heap_graph_class_aggregation;
SELECT 'java.util.WeakHashMap$Entry' AS key, coalesce((SELECT value FROM (
SELECT type_name AS key, SUM(reachable_obj_count) AS value
FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
WHERE graph_sample_ts = (
  SELECT MAX(graph_sample_ts) FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
)
GROUP BY type_name
HAVING value > 0
ORDER BY key

) WHERE key IS 'java.util.WeakHashMap$Entry'), 0) AS value
```

The `current` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.memory.heap_graph.heap_graph_class_aggregation;
SELECT 'java.util.WeakHashMap$Entry' AS key, coalesce((SELECT value FROM (
SELECT type_name AS key, SUM(reachable_obj_count) AS value
FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
WHERE graph_sample_ts = (
  SELECT MAX(graph_sample_ts) FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
)
GROUP BY type_name
HAVING value > 0
ORDER BY key

) WHERE key IS 'java.util.WeakHashMap$Entry'), 0) AS value
```

The `baseline` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.memory.heap_graph.heap_graph_class_aggregation;
SELECT 'float[]' AS key, coalesce((SELECT value FROM (
SELECT type_name AS key, SUM(reachable_obj_count) AS value
FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
WHERE graph_sample_ts = (
  SELECT MAX(graph_sample_ts) FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
)
GROUP BY type_name
HAVING value > 0
ORDER BY key

) WHERE key IS 'float[]'), 0) AS value
```

The `current` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.memory.heap_graph.heap_graph_class_aggregation;
SELECT 'float[]' AS key, coalesce((SELECT value FROM (
SELECT type_name AS key, SUM(reachable_obj_count) AS value
FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
WHERE graph_sample_ts = (
  SELECT MAX(graph_sample_ts) FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
)
GROUP BY type_name
HAVING value > 0
ORDER BY key

) WHERE key IS 'float[]'), 0) AS value
```

### c3. The range contains UI/layout changes, including smaller Interests thumbnails and a one-dp dialog-button padding change, but the trace evidence does not identify either change as a cause of a regression.

## Caveats

- the current trace's build was debuggable (run metadata: debuggable), so ART ran it with fewer optimisations and its timings overstate a release build's
- This conclusion is based on one capture per side; the 183-object difference may be within run-to-run variation.
- The traces were captured on an Android emulator using a debuggable build.
- Frame-time, startup, binder, GC, and native-heap metrics had no usable data in these traces, so this diagnosis is limited to the Java heap-graph metric.
