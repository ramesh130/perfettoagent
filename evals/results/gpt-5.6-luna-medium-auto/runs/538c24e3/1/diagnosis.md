## Metric

| Metric | Unit | Baseline | Current | Delta |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `heap_growth_objects_by_class` | objects | 399,535 | 399,352 | -183 |

Measured by:

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.memory.heap_graph.heap_graph_class_aggregation;
SELECT sum(value) AS value FROM (
SELECT type_name AS key, SUM(reachable_obj_count) AS value
FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
WHERE graph_sample_ts = (
  SELECT MAX(graph_sample_ts) FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
)
GROUP BY type_name
HAVING value > 0
ORDER BY key

)
```

## Claims

### c1. The measured reachable Java-object count decreased from 399535 in the baseline to 399352 in the current trace, a delta of -183 objects; this is not a regression for the selected metric.

The `baseline` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.memory.heap_graph.heap_graph_class_aggregation;
SELECT sum(value) AS value FROM (
SELECT type_name AS key, SUM(reachable_obj_count) AS value
FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
WHERE graph_sample_ts = (
  SELECT MAX(graph_sample_ts) FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
)
GROUP BY type_name
HAVING value > 0
ORDER BY key

)
```

The `current` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.memory.heap_graph.heap_graph_class_aggregation;
SELECT sum(value) AS value FROM (
SELECT type_name AS key, SUM(reachable_obj_count) AS value
FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
WHERE graph_sample_ts = (
  SELECT MAX(graph_sample_ts) FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
)
GROUP BY type_name
HAVING value > 0
ORDER BY key

)
```

### c2. The range includes a change to InterestsScreen thumbnail sizing and divider padding.

```

### c3. The range also includes a change to the fewer-stories dialog button padding, but the selected metric does not show a regression attributable to it.

The `current` trace: 1 row.

```sql
INCLUDE PERFETTO MODULE android.memory.heap_graph.heap_graph_class_aggregation;
SELECT sum(value) AS value FROM (
SELECT type_name AS key, SUM(reachable_obj_count) AS value
FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
WHERE graph_sample_ts = (
  SELECT MAX(graph_sample_ts) FROM android_heap_graph_class_aggregation
)
GROUP BY type_name
HAVING value > 0
ORDER BY key

)
```

## Caveats

- the current trace's build was debuggable (run metadata: debuggable), so ART ran it with fewer optimisations and its timings overstate a release build's
- Only the heap-object metric had data in these captures; frame timing, jank, startup, blocking, binder, GC, and native heap metrics returned no data.
- This comparison uses one baseline and one current capture, so it cannot establish run-to-run variability. The traces were captured on an emulator using a debuggable debug build.
