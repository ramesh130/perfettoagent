## Claims

### c1. The app's main-thread blocked time increased from 25.284169 ms in the baseline to 731.530503 ms in the current trace, a delta of 706.2463339999999 ms.

The `baseline` trace: 1 row.

      JOIN work AS w ON b.ts < w.ts + w.dur AND w.ts < b.ts + b.dur
    ), 0) / 1e6
  END AS value
```

The `current` trace: 1 row.

### c2. The current trace contains six approximately 120 ms input-delivery stalls, while the baseline's longest input-delivery slice was only 12.55275 ms.

The `baseline` trace: 1 row.

```sql
SELECT count(*) AS input_events, sum(dur)/1e6 AS input_event_ms, min(dur)/1e6 AS shortest_ms, max(dur)/1e6 AS longest_ms
FROM slice
WHERE name GLOB 'deliverInputEvent*'
```

The `current` trace: 1 row.

```sql
SELECT count(*) AS input_events, sum(dur)/1e6 AS input_event_ms, min(dur)/1e6 AS shortest_ms, max(dur)/1e6 AS longest_ms
FROM slice
WHERE name GLOB 'deliverInputEvent*'
```

### c3. Commit c70fd55eea9930f42380069d9b1f0a3f22bc403b changed FeedScreen.kt in this range; the trace's approximately 120 ms input stalls directly match the commit's added tap hold behavior.

### c4. The added tap-hold code is present in the range head and is attributed to c70fd55eea9930f42380069d9b1f0a3f22bc403b.

## Caveats

- This diagnosis compares one capture per side, so smaller changes could be affected by run-to-run noise; the observed input stalls are large relative to the baseline.
- The captures ran on an emulator (sdk_gphone64_arm64, SDK 36) in a non-debuggable benchmark build.
