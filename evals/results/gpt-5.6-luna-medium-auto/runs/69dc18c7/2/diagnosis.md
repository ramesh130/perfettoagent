## Claims

### c1. Main-thread blocked time increased from 25.284169 ms in the baseline to 731.530503 ms in the current trace, a delta of 706.2463339999999 ms.

The `baseline` trace: 1 row.

### c2. The current trace contains 12 deliverInputEvent slices lasting at least 100 ms, totaling 1454.417541 ms, while the baseline contains none.

The `current` trace: 1 row.

```sql
SELECT count(*) AS events_at_least_100ms, sum(dur)/1e6 AS total_ms, max(dur)/1e6 AS max_ms FROM slice WHERE name GLOB 'deliverInputEvent*' AND dur >= 100000000
```

The `baseline` trace: 1 row.

```sql
SELECT count(*) AS events_at_least_100ms, sum(dur)/1e6 AS total_ms, max(dur)/1e6 AS max_ms FROM slice WHERE name GLOB 'deliverInputEvent*' AND dur >= 100000000
```

### c3. Commit c70fd55eea9930f42380069d9b1f0a3f22bc403b added Thread.sleep(TAP_HOLD_MS) to FeedScreen's tap handler and introduced TAP_HOLD_MS as 120 ms, matching the approximately 120 ms long input events in the current trace.

### c4. Blame at the range head assigns the added Thread.sleep line to c70fd55eea9930f42380069d9b1f0a3f22bc403b.

## Caveats

- This diagnosis compares one capture per side, so the absolute metric values may contain run-to-run noise; the large increase and the new approximately 120 ms input-handler slices are substantially larger than typical noise.
- The current run metadata identifies an Android SDK 36 emulator benchmark build; emulator scheduling can affect timing.
